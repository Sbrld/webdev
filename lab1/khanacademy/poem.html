    <h1>Between Who I Was and Who I’m Becoming</h1>
    <p>I walk a road with yesterday’s dust<br>
Still clinging softly to my shoes,<br>
Dreams behind me, sharp with rust,<br>
New ones ahead I haven’t used.<br>
<br>
I carry doubts like quiet stones,<br>
Hidden deep inside my chest,<br>
Yet hope still hums within my bones,<br>
A restless fire that won’t let rest.<br>
<br>
The world speaks loud, I answer low,<br>
Learning strength in gentle tone,<br>
I’m not the man I used to know,<br>
Nor yet the king I’ll call my own.<br>
<br>
So here I stand, mid-breath, mid-flight,<br>
A heart in motion, not in chains,<br>
Growing slowly toward the light,<br>
Through unanswered prayers and pains.</p>
