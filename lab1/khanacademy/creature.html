        <p>The <em>Horse</em> is awesome because <strong>they are awesome because they combine incredible strength with elegance and sensitivity, making them both powerful and gentle at the same time. They can sense human emotions and respond to trust, which creates a deep bond between horse and rider. Plus, they’ve played a huge role in human history, from travel to warfare to farming.</strong>.</p>
